It is most probable in the vastness of this universe that your life will mean nothing, and so does your death, thus your determination
to hold on to your whittling life is futile if not foolish. The world would not notice your absence neither will it stop its course.
It will be seen as another inconvenience others have to deal with.

The things that matter are things invisible and uncomprehensible to the human mind that rejects its own uselessness. Meaning only exist
where we exist, what happened with anything does not possess any significance nor meaning to an invisible and even absent observer of
the universe which itself houses.

The world has no obligation to make up to you and justice is not a force of nature that enforeces balance to individuals. The pain you
experienced your whole life is not deserved nor asked but neither will it be justified for any reason or compensated in any way. It is
not life that gives you what you love, more often it takes, it is only your own illusion that makes you believe of life's way of
giving love for the human is desperate to give life the benefit of the doubt simply because the alternative is something hopeless and
too real for the fantastical imagination of a human brain. All this to say, your pain is your own doing. By caring, you expose yourself
to the inevitable pain of losing. This also is an illusion. Because by caring and the transitive property, you expose yourself to an
attempt to rediscover love - something all humans are desperate for as a way to block the reality of their existence and their place
in this violent universe.


So, in celebration of changing one number to another as we travel 6,307,200,000 kilometers through space, I present to you this truth
about life, the universe, and the human existence from the limited mind of a mere mortal on a planet full of life, then love, then
loss, then grief, and thus meaning.
